# 455 final project: Real-time hand gesture recognition - Stephen Ying #

For my real-time hand gesture recognition project, I mainly split the work into 3 main parts. The first part is to collect image data of different hand gestures with different meaning, and the second part is to train our model using google open source framwork Tensorflow. The last part is to use that model to classify our hand at real time using our webcam.
