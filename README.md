# 455 final project: Real-time hand gesture recognition - Stephen Ying #

For my real-time hand gesture recognition project, I mainly split the work into 2 main python scrips. The first scrip collects images of different hand gestures with different meaning/labeling through webcam, and the second script is to use the model built from training our images to determine what is the hand gesture currently showed in the webcam.
